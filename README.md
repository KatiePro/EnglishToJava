English to Java Mathematical Translator using a 
Context Free Grammar and Python's NLTK

The EJMT is a program that takes written English 
sentences as input and translates them to valid 
Java code snippets. The program’s intended purpose 
is to be a reference to beginner Java learners, as 
well as for those who need a refresher for this 
programming language.
          	
While interacting with the program, users receive 
helpful tips; these include suggestions for variable 
types and method modifiers. The program can ask 
users for missing information. For example, someone 
who says “Make an integer” will be asked what 
variable name they would like to initialize.
